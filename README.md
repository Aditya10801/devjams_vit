## Project Idea
A service that proposes a campus delivery system where students can order items like food, books, or stationery from on-campus shops. Another student nearby picks it up and delivers it. The delivery student earns reward points, which can be used for future orders, while the ordering student pays with reward points, or pays a small delivery fee if they lack points. The platform earns through convenience fees and shop commissions. Top point collectors receive rewards, fostering convenience and social connections among students.
