It is a peer to peer delivery service, where you as a user place an order to the on campus shops and cafes via our web app, which updates the nearby roaming students who might be coming to a place near you. THey can pickup the order and hand it over to you. Doing the delivery rewards them with a point which they can redeem as a delivery charge next time when they place an order.
The web app is made with a mobile first approach so we request you open in responsive mode
